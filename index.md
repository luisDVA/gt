With the **gt** package, anyone can make wonderful-looking tables using
the **R** programming language. The **gt** philosophy: we can construct
a wide variety of useful tables with a cohesive set of table parts.
These include the *table header*, the *stub*, the *column labels* and
*spanner column labels*, the *table body*, and the *table footer*.

</div>



It all begins with **table data** (be it a tibble or a data frame). You
then decide how to compose your **gt table** with the elements and
formatting you need for the task at hand. Finally, the table is rendered
by printing it at the console, including it in an R Markdown document,
or exporting to a file. Currently, **gt** supports the **HTML**, **LaTeX**,
and **RTF** output formats.

The **gt** package is designed to be both straightforward yet powerful.
The emphasis is on simple functions for the everyday display table
needs!
